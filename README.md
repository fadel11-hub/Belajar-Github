Lagu Somebody's Pleasure
I've beem so busy, ignoring and hiding
About what my heart actually say 

Stay awake while I'm drowing on my thoughts

Sometimes a happines is just a happiness
I've never been enjoying' my serenity
Even if I've got a lot of company

That makes me happy
soul try to figure it out
